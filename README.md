# nosql-social-nework-api
A NoSQL social network API using Express and Mongoose

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Geting Started

* You will need to have MongoDB, and Insomnia installed on your machine.
* Run "npm i" to install the dependent npm packages.

## Usage

The following walkthrough video shows how to launch the backend social media API and use INSOMNIA to test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints to create/update/delete users, add/remove friends, add/remove user thoughts, and add/remove reactions to user thoughts.
